# rl-state-tester

A testing project allowing you to do the following things :

- Play with your agent in its training environment
- Log your reward at a given rate of steps

Currently working with rlgym-ppo / rlgym2 on master, sb3 / rlgym on "player-recording" branch, this branch also has some of the features listed below

This branch is currently working, but since rlgym2 doesn't support rocket league yet, you can't see what you do.

## Incoming

### Comfort

- Hot reload on rewards and states, allowing you to change the rewards and states while the agent is playing (without restarting rocket league)

### Features

- Presets
  - Clip a moment you liked and state set your bot on it
  - Record yourself doing an action and replay it (a bit like TAS)
